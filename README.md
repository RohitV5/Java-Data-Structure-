primitive type - flota int double boolean

non primitive types - string, array (which has some functions and created using new keyword).

casting - implicit (automatic), explicit (manual) using cast()

defining const with final keyword.

operators: arithmetic, logic, comparison

Math class - some useful functions like min, max , random

strings are immutable - once defined u can' change its value in memory.

Steps to solve DSA

1.Understand the problem: Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems if necessary.
2.Identify teh inputs and outputs. Determing what inputs the problem require and what output are expected.
3.Consider the constraints. Take note of any constraints or limitations that may affect how you approach the problem.
4.Explore different solutions. Think about different ways to solve the problem, and consider the trade-offs between them.
5.Choose a solution. Select the approach that you believe will work best and start implementing it in code.
6.Optimize the solution. Look for ways to improve the performance of your solution.
7.Test your solution. Test your solution with a sample inputs and edge cases to ensure it works correctly. 
8.Refactor the solution. If necessary, consider refactoring the solution to improve readability maintainability and performance.
9.Analyze the space and time complexity. It is important to measure how well the solution performs in terms of time and space complexity.
